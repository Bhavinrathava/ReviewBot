# Commit Selection Feature - Complete Guide

## Overview
The Velocity Review extension now provides users with flexible commit selection options when starting a code review. Instead of only reviewing the latest commit, users can choose to either review the latest commit or select from the last 10 commits.

## User Experience Flow

### Step 1: Start Review Options
When users click the "Start Review" button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è), they are presented with two options:

**üî• Review Latest Commit**
- Description: "Review the most recent commit"
- Detail: "Quick review of the latest changes"
- Action: Immediately proceeds with the latest commit

**üìã Choose from Recent Commits**
- Description: "Select a specific commit to review"
- Detail: "Browse and select from the last 10 commits"
- Action: Shows commit selection interface

### Step 2: Commit Selection Interface (if "Choose from Recent Commits" selected)

Users see a list of up to 10 recent commits with rich information:

**Commit Display Format:**
```
üî• a1b2c3d4 - Add new authentication feature
by John Doe on 12/25/2025
3 files, 45 lines changed

abc12345 - Fix bug in user validation
by Jane Smith on 12/24/2025
1 file, 12 lines changed

def67890 - Update documentation
by Bob Johnson on 12/23/2025
2 files, 8 lines changed
```

**Visual Indicators:**
- üî• Latest commit is marked with fire emoji
- Short hash (8 characters) for easy identification
- Commit message for context
- Author and date information
- File and line change statistics

## Technical Implementation

### New Functions Added

#### `getRecentCommits(workspaceRoot: string, maxCount: number = 10): Promise<CommitOption[]>`
- Retrieves recent commits from git repository
- Generates rich display information for each commit
- Handles edge cases (initial commits, empty repositories)
- Returns formatted commit options for UI display

#### `getDetailedCommitChangesByHash(workspaceRoot: string, commitHash: string): Promise<DetailedCommitChanges | null>`
- Analyzes specific commit by hash
- Generates detailed JSON structure for any commit
- Handles parent-less commits (initial commit)
- Provides same detailed analysis as latest commit function

### Enhanced Start Review Logic

**Updated Workflow:**
1. **Option Selection**: User chooses review type
2. **Commit Selection** (if applicable): User selects specific commit
3. **Configuration Check**: Validates API settings
4. **Analysis**: Analyzes selected commit
5. **Review Generation**: Creates AI-powered review
6. **Results Display**: Shows review in new document

### Commit Selection Interface

**CommitOption Interface:**
```typescript
interface CommitOption {
  label: string;      // "üî• a1b2c3d4 - Commit message"
  description: string; // "by Author on Date"
  detail: string;     // "X files, Y lines changed"
  hash: string;       // Full commit hash
}
```
