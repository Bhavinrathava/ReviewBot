# VSCode Extension Publishing & Sharing Guide

## Overview
There are several ways to publish and share your Velocity Review extension, ranging from official marketplace publication to simple file sharing. Here's a comprehensive guide for all options.

## Option 1: Official VSCode Marketplace (Recommended)

### Prerequisites
1. **Microsoft Account**: You'll need a Microsoft account
2. **Azure DevOps Organization**: Required for publishing
3. **Publisher Account**: Create a publisher profile

### Step-by-Step Publishing Process

#### 1. Install VSCE (Visual Studio Code Extension Manager)
```bash
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
```

#### 2. Create Publisher Account
```bash
# Login to create/manage publisher
vsce login <publisher-name>
```

Or create one at: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage

#### 3. Update package.json
Ensure your `package.json` has required fields:
```json
{
  "name": "velocityReview",
  "displayName": "Velocity Review",
  "description": "AI-powered code review extension",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "publisher": "your-publisher-name",
  "repository": {

  "categories": ["Other"],
  "icon": "velocity.png"
}
```

#### 4. Package the Extension
```bash
# Create .vsix package
vsce package

# This creates: velocityReview-1.0.0.vsix
```

#### 5. Publish to Marketplace

## Current Extension Status Check

Let me check your current extension setup:

### Package.json Analysis
Your current package.json needs these updates for publishing:
- ✅ Name: "velocityReview"

## Quick Start: Package Your Extension Now

### 1. Install VSCE
