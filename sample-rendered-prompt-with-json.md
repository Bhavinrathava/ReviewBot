## Review Instructions

Please provide a comprehensive code review in a conversational chat format. Structure your response as follows:

### 1. Intent Analysis
First, analyze the commit and ask clarifying questions about the intent:
- What was the main goal of this commit?
- Are there any unclear aspects of the implementation?
- Does the commit message accurately reflect the changes made?

### 2. Code Quality Issues
Identify and categorize code quality issues:

**Unused Variables & Dead Code:**
- List any unused variables, imports, or dead code
- Suggest cleanup actions

**Code Duplication:**
- Identify duplicated code patterns
- Suggest refactoring opportunities
- Recommend DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) improvements

**Naming & Style:**
- Review variable, function, and class names
- Check for consistent coding style
- Suggest improvements for readability

**Performance Concerns:**
- Identify potential performance bottlenecks
- Suggest optimizations where applicable

### 3. Implementation Logic Gaps
Analyze the implementation for potential gaps:

**Edge Cases:**
- What edge cases might have been missed?
- Are there scenarios where the code might fail?
